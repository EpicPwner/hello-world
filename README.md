Learning to use GitHub

1. This paragraph was my first commit.

2. This one is to see changes between commits.

3. Changed from a clone in my desktop made using Git Bash. (format - "git clone git://github.com/'username'/'projectname')

4. In the previous step I pushed the commit from Git Bash (format - "git push -u https://github.com/'username'/'projectname'.git

And now I will commit a change from Git GUI and push it on github.com
